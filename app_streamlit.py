The Streamlit interface. A different thin layer over the SAME system.

Run it:
    streamlit run app_streamlit.py
Then open the local URL it prints in the terminal.

Notice: we import the exact same diagnose() and format_diagnosis() from
diagnoser.py. The system did not change. Only the interface did.
